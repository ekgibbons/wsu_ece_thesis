\prefacesection{Acknowledgements}

The Acknowledgements page is optional and limited to four pages. It precedes the Abstract page. Heading is bold if other major headings are bold. It is in the same font size and style as text, and the vertical spacing, and paragraph style margins are the same as used in text. Use complete sentences.

An example would be something along the lines of:   I would like to thank my committee chair, Professor Smith, and my committee Professor Johns and Professor Williams, for their guidance and support throughout the course of this research.
In addition, I would also like to thank my friends, colleagues, and the department faculty and staff for making my time at Weber State University a positive experience...
