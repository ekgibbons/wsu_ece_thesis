\prefacesection{Abstract}

The text of the Abstract is double-spaced or space-and-a-half according to the spacing style of the text of the project report/thesis. Follow the same margin settings as your narrative text. The page number (lower case Roman numeral) should be placed at the top center of the page.

Your Abstract must be a ``complete snapshot'' of your manuscript and be a stand-alone piece. Since the text of the Abstract may be distributed widely through a variety of databases, formal citations, images, and complex equations should not be included. Paragraph one introduces your specific problem and the methods used. The remaining paragraphs present the research and results in detail.
